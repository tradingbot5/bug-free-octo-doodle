description: "Hunt HTTP request smuggling / desync (CL.TE, TE.CL, TE.TE, H2.CL, H2.TE, TE.0, 0.CL, client-side desync). Cause: front-end proxy and back-end disagree on where one request ends and the next begins (Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding, chunk-terminator ambiguity, HTTP/2→1.1 downgrade). Covers the 2024-2025 research wave — TE.0 (GCP), 0.CL / 'HTTP/1.1 must die' desync endgame, Funky Chunks chunk-terminator overreads, client-side & browser-powered desync, HTTP Request Smuggler v3.0 parser-discrepancy detection, WAFFLED parser-diff WAF bypass. Detection: Burp HTTP Request Smuggler v3, smuggler.py, h2csmuggler, timing probes. Validate on a request issued by a DIFFERENT client/session — cache poisoning, mass credential harvesting (collector gadget), auth bypass to internal routes, request-queue poisoning.

## 17. HTTP REQUEST SMUGGLING
> Lowest dup rate. $5K–$30K. PortSwigger research by James Kettle.

### CL.TE (Content-Length front, Transfer-Encoding back)
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

### Detection
```
1. Burp extension: HTTP Request Smuggler
2. Right-click request → Extensions → HTTP Request Smuggler → Smuggle probe
3. Manual timing: CL.TE probe + ~10s delay = backend waiting for rest of body
```

### Impact Chain
```
Poison next request → access admin as victim
Steal credentials → capture victim's session
Cache poisoning → stored XSS at scale
```

## Target-Suitability Matrix (2026 reality check)

The classic CL.TE / TE.CL payloads are NOT universally exploitable in 2026. Modern proxies are RFC 9112 strict by default. Fingerprint the front-end BEFORE investing time.

| Front-end | CL.TE | TE.CL | H2.CL | H2.TE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Nginx ≥ 1.21** | NO | NO | partial (H2 ingress) | partial | RFC-strict; rejects CL+TE with HTTP 400. Verified locally on Nginx 1.27 — all 9 documented variants killed by front-end ([docs/verification/phase2h-smuggling-cachepoison.md](../../docs/verification/phase2h-smuggling-cachepoison.md)). |
| **Caddy 2.x** | NO | NO | — | — | Hardened by default |
| **Envoy ≥ 1.20** | NO | NO | partial | partial | Hardened in most paths |
| **HAProxy ≤ 2.4** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | **Vulnerable**, see CVE-2021-40346 |
| **AWS ALB + specific upstream** | partial | partial | ✓ | ✓ | Several disclosed-paid reports 2022-2024 |
| **Cloudflare → S3 / Lambda chains** | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | H2-downgrade attacks remain viable |
| **Older F5 BIG-IP (TMM < 16)** | ✓ | — | — | — | Vendor advisories |
| **Citrix ADC / NetScaler (older firmware)** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | Disclosed in 2020-2022 |
| **Squid 3.x** | ✓ | — | — | — | Older deployments |
| **Apache Traffic Server (older)** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | PortSwigger research |
| **Apache mod_proxy_ajp → Tomcat** | — | — | — | — | Cross-protocol HTTP→AJP desync (CVE-2022-26377); smuggled request is opaque to the WAF and reaches internal AJP admin/status paths that lack the external auth controls |
| **Custom Python / Go proxies** | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | Frequently miss RFC enforcement |

### Operator fingerprint quick-check

```bash
curl -sI https://target/ | grep -i "Server:"
```

- `nginx/1.21+`, `Caddy`, `envoy` → CL/TE classic is dead — pivot to H2.CL/H2.TE if the front-end speaks HTTP/2, or look for legacy proxies upstream
- `HAProxy`, header points to AWS/CDN → run the full payload matrix
- No Server header → assume hardened, but run a single quick `space-before-colon` probe; if it doesn't 400, dig deeper

### H2.CL / H2.TE (the modern dominant vector)

H2-downgrade smuggling attacks rely on the front-end speaking HTTP/2 to the client and HTTP/1.1 to origin. The downgrade introduces CL/TE confusion because HTTP/2's frame-length headers don't survive the conversion cleanly. Most CDN+origin chains in 2024-2026 use this exact topology.

Tools that send HTTP/2 raw frames (Burp Pro's HTTP Request Smuggler extension, `h2csmuggler`, `smuggler.py`) are the right starting point against CDN-fronted targets. Avoid HTTP/1.1-only test clients (curl, raw sockets) against H2-front-ended targets — you'll send the wrong protocol entirely.

### Mass credential harvesting — the "collector gadget"
The highest-impact smuggling outcome needs no per-victim interaction. Instead of blindly poisoning the queue, smuggle a request aimed at a **back-end handler that echoes the full request** — a search endpoint that reflects headers, or a redirect that mirrors the request line. The next victim's headers (`Cookie`, `Authorization`, `X-Access-Token`) get attributed to your smuggled request, and the reflecting handler returns them **in a response you read**. Repeated on a busy keep-alive socket, this harvests live credentials from arbitrary users at scale — and it works even through a CDN (Akamai/Cloudflare) when the CDN↔origin hop desyncs. Chains to `hunt-ato`.

## New Techniques (2024-2026)

The CL/TE classic is mostly dead on RFC-9112-strict proxies. The live money is in the chunk-terminator and HTTP/2-downgrade discrepancies below.

### TE.0 (2024 — Google Cloud / GCP load balancer)
Front-end honours `Transfer-Encoding`, back-end treats the connection as having **no** body boundary (effectively CL:0), so the chunked body is reinterpreted as a new request. Hit hard on GCP-hosted sites behind the classic GCLB. Probe: send a valid `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request whose trailing bytes form a smuggled request line; watch for the smuggled response or a timing delta on the shared socket.

### 0.CL and the "double-desync" / HTTP/1.1-must-die class (James Kettle, 2025)
*HTTP/1.1 must die: the desync endgame* turns previously "unexploitable" **0.CL deadlocks** into reliable smuggling using:
- **`Expect: 100-continue` handling quirks** to control when the back-end starts reading the body.
- **Early-response gadgets** (an endpoint that responds before reading the full body) to break the deadlock and merge your smuggled bytes into the next request.
This yields **response-queue poisoning** and cross-tenant cache/content hijacking against stacks that passed older smuggling scanners. If a target is HTTP/1.1 upstream, this is now the first thing to try.

### Funky Chunks + addendum (2025 — chunk-terminator ambiguity)
New primitives that need no CL-vs-TE confusion at all — they abuse **chunked body parsing** itself:
- **Two-byte chunk-body terminator overreads** — proxy and origin disagree on whether the chunk data ends at `\r\n` vs a single byte, spilling attacker bytes across the boundary.
- **Ignored chunk-extension line terminators (EXT.TERM)** — `chunk-size;ext\r\n` where the two ends parse the extension/terminator differently.
- **Ambiguous trailer-section newline handling** and **oversized-chunk spill**.
Combined with early-response gadgets these enable **request merging**. Test with Burp HTTP Request Smuggler v3's chunk-ext and terminator payloads.

### Client-side & browser-powered desync (CSD)
No proxy desync required — a single reverse proxy/CDN plus a victim browser is enough. Lure the victim to attacker JS that issues cross-origin `fetch` with `keepalive`/pipelined bodies; the connection-reuse desync lands the smuggled request on the *victim's own* authenticated connection → same-origin request-smuggling → ATO/cache-poison from a drive-by. Validate with Burp's "browser-powered" option.

### Tooling update — HTTP Request Smuggler v3.0 (2025)
v3 adds **parser-discrepancy detection** (the "powered by differential fuzzing" engine) that finds desyncs widespread defences miss, plus 0.CL / chunk-terminator probes. Re-run v3 against targets that were clean on v1/v2. Related research: **Gudifu** (guided differential fuzzing for parsing discrepancies) and **WAFFLED** (exploiting the *same* parser discrepancies to bypass WAFs — a smuggling-adjacent WAF-evasion primitive, not a standalone finding).

## Remediation

- Terminate HTTP/1.1 upstream; speak HTTP/2 end-to-end (no downgrade) or use a single, RFC-9112-strict parser on both hops.
- Reject any request carrying both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`; reject malformed chunk sizes, chunk extensions, and non-`\r\n` terminators (don't "normalise and forward").
- Disable connection reuse between the front-end and back-end for requests whose framing was ambiguous; prefer one-request-per-connection to origin where feasible.
- Normalise/strip `Expect: 100-continue` at the edge; ensure early-response endpoints still drain the request body.
- Keep front-end proxy/CDN and origin on patched versions (HAProxy CVE-2021-40346, Apache AJP CVE-2022-26377, GCLB TE.0 fixes, etc.).

## Validation Gate (do not report without this)

The smuggled effect **must land on a request issued by a different client/session**, not your own follow-up request. Confirm with one of:
1. **Collaborator / OOB** — smuggled request causes an out-of-band callback attributable to a victim connection.
2. **Reflected victim data** — a collector-gadget response returns another session's `Cookie`/`Authorization`.
3. **Shared-cache poisoning** — a second, independent browser receives your injected response from the cache.
A timing delay observed only in your own browser is parser disagreement, not exploitable smuggling. Always test against a lab/own account first; never run queue-poisoning payloads that would serve attacker content to real users on a production program without explicit authorization (DoS/other-user-impact risk).

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`hunt-cache-poison`** — Smuggling + cache is the canonical critical chain; one smuggled request becomes the cached response for every subsequent victim. Chain primitive: CL.TE smuggle a request whose response body contains attacker HTML/JS → front-end cache stores it under a popular URL (`/`, `/login`) → de-sync poisoning where the smuggled request becomes the cached response for the next N victims, persisting for the cache TTL.
- **`hunt-auth-bypass`** — Smuggling reaches internal-only routes that the front-end WAF/auth-proxy filters out. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /admin/users HTTP/1.1` past the front-end ACL that blocks external `/admin/*` → backend processes the smuggled request as if from a trusted internal source → bypass front-end auth by smuggling internal-routed request → admin data in the response queue.
- **`hunt-idor`** — Smuggling attaches the NEXT user's session cookies to an attacker-controlled request path. Chain primitive: smuggle `GET /api/me HTTP/1.1` with no cookies → backend pairs it with the next legitimate user's incoming connection cookies → victim's session cookie attached to attacker's smuggled request → attacker reads the response containing victim's PII/tokens.
- **`hunt-xss`** — Smuggling injects XSS payloads into the response stream of the next victim without ever appearing in a URL parameter. Chain primitive: smuggled request body contains reflected payload that the backend renders into the next response in the queue → next visitor to `/` receives attacker HTML inline → reflected XSS at every visitor without any URL parameter visible to them or to logs.
- **`security-arsenal`** — Reach for the smuggling payload bank (CL.TE / TE.CL / TE.TE obfuscations, H2.CL downgrade probes, h2csmuggler one-liners, Burp HTTP Request Smuggler extension config) and the time-delay confirmation template before manual hex-editing.
- **`triage-validation`** — Run the Pre-Severity Gate before claiming Critical: the smuggled-request effect MUST land on a request issued by a different client/session, not your own follow-up. A timing delta in your own browser alone is parser disagreement, not exploitable smuggling.
